# arduno based nano-bert rpc
This Arduino library provides a light weight serializer and parser for messagepack.

## Install
Download the zip, and import it with your Arduino IDE: *Sketch>Include Library>Add .zip library*

## Usage
See the either the `.h` file, or the examples ().


## Limitations

Currently the library does **not** support:
* Requires manually coding switch statement to call appropriate handler functions
* Uses packet based radios -- more work needs to be done on timing and data buffers
